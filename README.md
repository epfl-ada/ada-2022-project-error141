# Damsel in distress: a recurrent pattern in movies? 
## Abstract
The damsel in distress is a standard narrative device that portrays female protagonists in the face of perilous situations as completely helpless. Indeed, they constantly need a male savior to help them escape their dangerous predicaments. Their agency is completely stripped away from them. More generally, women in the media are often portrayed as passive participants of narratives. They are only tools to provide motivation and purpose to the lead male characters. Using the movie summary corpus, our project aims to explore the "activeness" of female characters in movies and its evolution through time. Using natural language processing, the latter would be performed by searching for verbs and adjectives associated with the female characters in the summary and by investigating what type of power it gives to it. For homogeneity reasons, we decided to focus on US movies since 1940.

## Research questions: 
* How has the role of women in American cinema evolved through the decades? 
* Are women having more active roles lately? Is this activeness more related to the film genres that women usually play in, for example, family or romantic movies? 
* What action and descriptive adjectives are most often associated with female characters? Are they different from the ones associated with their male counterpart?
* Is there any correlation between active/passive roles of a woman and a positive/negative connotation? Are negatively connotated women more active than positively connotated ones? 
* Can we predict a characterâ€™s gender from the verbs and adjectives associated with them?

## Proposed additional dataset
We decided to base our analysis on the plot summary of the movies. As an additional data set, we would like to use the IMDb dataset (https://www.imdb.com/interfaces) in order to compare the distribution of movies by year of release and genres of the CMU corpus and of all movies available on IMDb.

## Methods
This project is based on the analysis of plot summaries of the CMU Movie Summary Corpus. Data exploration of the dataset is thus performed. 

First, it might be noticed that the distribution of movies through time in the CMU dataset reflects the total distribution of films released worldwide as their evolution is similar. Additionally, it was found that the distribution of the genres of movies in our dataset is comparable to the distribution in all the movies released based on IMDb dataset. 
A first analysis of movie producing countries shows that the United States is the largest producer in the 20th century and early 21st century. In order to carry out an analysis that allows us to observe an evolution over time, the project is based on American movies. Indeed, they constitute the largest component of the dataset and so as to avoid possible bias caused by different countries of production and consequently different cultures, we decided to restrain our analysis over this subset. 
Next, it is assessed that the distribution of the U.S. dataset reflects the distribution of the total dataset in terms of genre. We only considered movies released since 1940 as the number of movies released the years before was too low for a meaningful analysis.

In order to confirm the statement that female characters are less empowered than male characters in movies, we first compared the number of female vs male characters in movies (32% female vs 68% male) which shows that women are much less represented in movies. To go further in the analysis, we observed the evolution of the number of characters by gender through time for American movies. As previously mentioned in the abstract, the typical role of the character depending on the gender is very different. To visualize this point, we plotted the genres of the movies by order of highest number of male characters and the top 10 were kept. A similar plot was performed by considering the female characters. Even though some of the genres are shared by both plots, the distribution is not the same. For example, 5 out of 10 of the top genres of female characters are related to romance, family or music whereas male characters are much more present in movies related to action, danger and adventure. To attempt to get a general idea of the evolution of these numbers, we investigated the possible increase of female characters in two stereoptypical genres for male and female characters. A general trend of decrease in the difference between the percentage of male and female characters can be observed.
These preliminary results support the aim of the project.
For the summary to be moderately representative of the movie scenario and the type of role of the main characters, it is necessary to exploit only the summaries that have at least 350 words. The last and the previously mentioned restrictions yield a subset of 7714 movies. However, note that there is a bias in the content of the summaries due to the fact that most Wikipedia writers (around 85%) are men.[1]
