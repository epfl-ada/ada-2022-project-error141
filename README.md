# Damsel in distress: a recurrent pattern in movies? 
## Abstract
The damsel in distress is a standard narrative device that portrays female protagonists in the face of perilous situations as completely helpless. Indeed, they constantly need a male savior to help them escape their dangerous predicaments. Their agency is completely stripped away from them. More generally, women in the media are often portrayed as passive participants of narratives. They are only tools to provide motivation and purpose to the lead male characters. Using the movie summary corpus, our project aims to explore the "activeness" of female characters in movies and its evolution through time. Using natural language processing, the latter would be performed by searching for verbs and adjectives associated with the female characters in the summary and by investigating what type of power it gives to it. For homogeneity reasons, we decided to focus on US movies since 1940.

## Research questions: 
* How has the role of women in American cinema evolved through the decades? 
* Are women having more active roles lately? Is this activeness more related to the film genres that women usually play in, for example, family or romantic movies? 
* What action and descriptive adjectives are most often associated with female characters? Are they different from the ones associated with their male counterpart?
* Is there any correlation between active/passive roles of a woman and a positive/negative connotation? Are negatively connotated women more active than positively connotated ones? 
* Can we predict a characterâ€™s gender from the verbs and adjectives associated with them?

## Proposed additional dataset
We decided to base our analysis on the plot summary of the movies. As an additional data set, we would like to use the IMDb dataset (https://www.imdb.com/interfaces) in order to compare the distribution of movies by year of release and genres of the CMU corpus and of all movies available on IMDb.
